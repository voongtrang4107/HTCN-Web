        <h2>Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)</h2>
        <p>
          The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth
          century,<strong>Leonhard</strong>Euler was born in Basel, Switzerland.
          There, he studied under another giant of mathematics,
          <strong> Jean Bernoulli</strong>. In 1731 Euler became a professor of
          physics and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Euler
          was the most prolific mathematician of all time, publishing over 800
          different books and papers. His influence was felt in physics and
          astronomy as well. Euler's work on mathematical analysis, Introductio
          in analysin infinitorum (1748) remained a standard textbook for well
          over a century. For the princess of Anhalt-Dessau he wrote Lettres a
          une princesse d'Allemagne (1768-1772), giving a clear non-technical
          outline of the main physical theories of the time.>

          One can hardly do math without copying Euler. Notations still in use
          today, such as e and pi, were introduced in Euler's writings. He is
          perhaps best known for his research into mathematical analysis.
          Euler's formula
        </p>

        <p>cos(x) + isin(x) = e <sup>(ix)</sup></p>

        <p>
          demonstrates the relationship between algebra, complex analysis, and
          trigonometry. From this equation, it's easy to derive the equation
        </p>

        <p>e <sup>(&#8719; i) </sup>+ 1 = 0</p>
        <p>
          which relates the fundamental constants: 0, 1, &#8719;, e, and i in a
          single beautiful and elegant statement.
        </p>

          Leonhard Euler died in 1783, leaving behind a legacy perhaps
          unmatched, and certainly unsurpassed, in the annals of mathematics.
